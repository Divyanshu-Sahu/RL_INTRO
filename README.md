# RL_INTRO

The first project aims to solve the [MountainCar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) problem using the Q-Learning algorithm. We start with an epsilon greedy policy which lets the agent explore to find an optimal solution. The results show the minimum, average and maximum reward with respect to the number of episodes.
